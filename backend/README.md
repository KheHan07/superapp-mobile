# WSO2 Super App Mobile Backend

This is the Ballerina based backend for the WSO2 Superapp Mobile. It powers the mobile experience by exposing RESTful APIs, integrating with databases, and retrieving entity information from internal services. The backend is modular and designed for scalability, security, and reusability across multiple micro-apps.
